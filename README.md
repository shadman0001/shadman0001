I have over 10 years of experience in electronic design and development. I am skilled in tools like Altium, Eagle, Proteus, and EasyEDA. My expertise includes microcontroller programming and embedded systems design. I also have experience in manufacturing, quality assurance, and collaborating with software engineers. I am highly motivated, deadline-oriented, and focused on delivering high-quality results.
